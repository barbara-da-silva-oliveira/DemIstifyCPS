	#** "This influence is a simple test" **#	
	Influence i1 from a1 and from phenomena cp1 
		emerges Emergent Behavior characterized by "an oscillation of phase" 
		that implies system response resulting in "a huge energy consumtpion increase" 
		which may violate rs1 it can be compensated by modifying a2
