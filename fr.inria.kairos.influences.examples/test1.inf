	Requirement noCollision : satisfied when "the number of Obstacle Collision is equals to 0"
			 
	Phenomenon wind: "wind"
	Phenomenon temperature: "temperature" 
	Phenomenon humidity: "humidity" 
 	  
	Influence i1 #** "This influence is a simple test" **#
	    originators: artifact motorSpeed and artifact motorType and phenomena wind 
		affects system response TTC
		 
	 
	Influence i2 #** "This influence is a minimal test" **#	
	originators: system response "i1.TTC" and artifact threshold
	affects system response StoppedDistanceToObstacle 
	
	Influence i3 #** "This influence is a another test" **#	
	originators: system response "i1.TTC" and artifact ultraSonicSensorType and phenomena humidity and phenomena temperature
	affects system response DistanceMeasureAccuracy 
	
	Composite Influence i4 #** "This is a composite Influence" **#
	encapsulate i1 i2 i3
	affects system response numberCollision used in noCollision
